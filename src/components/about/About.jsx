          Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams of
          young kids who wanted to show their mastery in their chosen fields,
          but were directed towards a factory for daily wages. Each cracker
          bursts brighter than their lost smiles, and can be heard louder than
          their cries for miles. Buy them, burst them, brag about them. <br />
          <span>The choice is yours. Because they donâ€™t have one.</span>
